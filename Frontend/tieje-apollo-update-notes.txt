Now that the database exists as a real database and http://api.semblance.us/graphql works I can actually start experimenting with Apollo.
`npm start` will be used most of the time for determining if the code runs without major errors.
`docker-compose` will be used when using Apollo to grab data from graphQL
A second Dockerfile will need to be written for development such that it will not spin up nginx.
The nginx multi-stage only copies and serves the build files, which is not useful for development.

+ create a second Dockerfile called Dockerfile-dev for the frontend and backend that does not spin up nginx or gunicorn and instead uses `npm start` and manage.py runserver
+ rewrite the main docker-compose file such that it uses localhost for the backend and frontend

Monday and Tuesday are going to be boring days that I'll use to learn and review Apollo.
