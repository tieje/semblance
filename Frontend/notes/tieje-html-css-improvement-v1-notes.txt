The goal of this branch is to make the html and css consistent and good-looking.
This project ties in well with what I'm learning right now in school.

The big question is, what should I focus on first?
html? css? Or perhaps a button to make the entire app visible on one screen?
It's a little bit of both. I'll do anything that I need to do make the app look good.

I should probably not be using so many divs in react.
Too many divs. I should use a more fixed kind of container.

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element
div elements are actually supposed to be elements of last resort

Right now I'm weighing the benefits of trying to make my site more accessible and less reliant on catch-all divs.
I know what I should do. There is no sense denying that I need to replace my current html.

html is a lot less about functionality and much more about readability and accessibility for users and developers.
Basically everything functions like a div. Div is the catch-all but it's not specific enough.

A great resource for html
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
Why was this so hard to find???
https://spec.whatwg.org/
It's not impossible for me to go through the whole specification.
I'd like to go briefly read through one specification per day.
Because the web pages are so simple, I've been able to figure out some interesting CSS tricks.
Along with reading one section per day, it will be useful to see if there is a type of html tag that exists for a specific use.
I'll probably do this.
Scratch that, I probably won't be able to realistically read this whole thing.
I'll need to pick and choose what I want to learn.
I do need to at least skim the headings so that I know what's possible with HTML.
For now, I want to start high level and then deal with the rest later.
Go high level first and then go as you go on.

Things I can fix or create:
- add the header tag with a nav tag
- add the footer tag with information
- add the main tag for your main application
- replace the current archetype list with actual unordered list items
- replace the archetype matrix with the table <tag>. This might complicate the current design a bit.
- replace the description box with a blockquote and add some citations.
- limit the description box size to a specific pixel width for a specific pixel width for devices
- replace the big container divs with sections
- add the proximity to the same div as the google map. Have proximity and and google maps be separate fragments in one div
- make the pronouns looking for into a fragment? It just needs to be in something that can be toggled.
- Turn the Results section into a table
- turn the chat into a list with a text input

- resizing of selected archetypes
- resize and reorganize map and proximity and results components
- add a non-function nav-bar
- create all the image versions of the logo that Nels created
- put some react router in there to switch between the homepage and the application
