I should probably read the nginx cookbook at night. It's like a manual, but with examples.

start on page 23


1. Change the state management system to Apollo
2. Set up graphql queries to the backend.
3. Find and set up a 3rd-party database service that you'd like to use for django
4. Create application data.
5. Make Gender component stateful.
6. Add a second gender component for whoever you're looking for.
7. Make Proximity component stateful.
8. Results Component
9. Chat component
10. Host site online. Learn about networking.
11. Add SSL certificate.
12. ufw security
13. HAproxy or nginx load-balancing.
14. Login page, logout page, forgot password page, forgot username page, user authentication and emails.
15. Google maps cluster results (if you can).
16. Incorporate Stripe payment services.
17. Improve CSS
18. Marketing
19. Write jest, cypress, and django tests

I have a bit of reading and studying to do tonight. I'll work on nginx tomorrow.
It would be far better for me to figure out what I'm doing for nginx, networks, and routing first than to experiment.

I'll need to figure out SSL certificates too prior to moving forward...
