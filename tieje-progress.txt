I have a bit of reading and studying to do tonight. I'll work on nginx tomorrow.
It would be far better for me to figure out what I'm doing for nginx, networks, and routing first than to experiment.

I'll need to figure out SSL certificates too prior to moving forward...

I will not work on my side project until I'm finished with my mandatory projects.
It's too difficult to transition from the mandatory project to the side project.
The 1 hour practice interview question is important for waking me up in the morning and ensuring that I can fulfill my job.

7:30 - 8am - get ready, eat a little
8 - 12pm - work
12 - 3pm - workout, eat, bear, shower, dishes, chores, tea (in this order)
3 - 7pm - work
7 - 9pm - eat/relax
9 - 11:30pm - Bread time

I have returned from hibernation.

Portfolio Site
- Create a simple portfolio Website with Gatsby from a template
- The static host site should be hosted on netlify

Website

Frontend

Form
- Design the website on Figma: Do something simple and good looking for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Redo the HTML of the website.
- Redo the CSS of the frontend with Tailwind, CSS Grid, or Bootstrap. (Don't rely solely on flex-box this time)
- Add Animation from anim.xyz

Function is good enough for now.

Backend
- lots of stuff to do. Just focus on the Frontend.

Goal: get a normal Fullstack Job. Showcase your skills.

I've decided that I don't really want to build this application anymore.
Mostly because I already have a wife.
It's not that hard to meet people.
